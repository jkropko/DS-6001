820,Town,Donald Trump,False,Donald Trump,"Immigration has been and has become a very big problem. The gangs, drug wars, the crime has climbed in every single town, county, state in this country and I believe it all revolves around too many different races, too many prejudices. Most people I talk to dislike foreigners and most foreigners hate Americans. We ask, why come here then? Because they get financial aid, housing, medical, dental aid and compared to the wars, poverty and the way they lived in their own country, America is heaven. They take our labor jobs and are costing taxpayer's billions of dollars in either Social Services Aid, or to house them in our jails. The town I grew up in was primarily white, middle class, working people. Today, white is the minority. The pretty little town is littered with gravity, trash, it's horrible how in 20 years a town that was so pretty for decades in a short 20 years looks like a ghetto town. Gangs, drugs, shootings, violent crimes are a normal every day occurrence. There was one murder recorded in the entire decade of 1980. 1990, 2 murders. So far since 2000 there have been a record breaking [REDACTED 3-DIGIT NUMBER] murders. The town I refer to is [REDACTED CITY AND STATE], which is located [REDACTED NUMBER] miles [REDACTED CARDINAL DIRECTION] of [REDACTED CITY] and the dumping ground for the over flowing HUD people from [REDACTED CITY]. It is in the [REDACTED COUNTY] County. Why and how this problem got so out of hand is Americans not paying attention to what are former Presidents were doing, as far as letting all of these nationalities in. There are so many Islams in this country, it's only a matter of time before something far worse than a military man kill 3 Americans. They have something far worse planned for us and we greeted them with open arms. Gave them everything they needed to begin a new life. What about our own homeless people? Our own veterans, living in poverty? Our own elderly, myself included? We are offered nothing. Told 'you do not qualify' for anything. If you lose your job or unable to work and it is not life threatening, you are screwed. I've worked since I was 15 years old. At 58 became disabled but not a life threatening disability, I got nothing. Zero. Not one dollar for unemployment, not enough work credits. Not eligible for social security, too young and haven't worked enough hours for disability. I was not able to get help with housing, utility bills, food, nothing. So I can understand why so many are homeless. However, if I was hispanic, pregnant, but never worked or paid a dollar to this country, I would be set for the next 18 years!
