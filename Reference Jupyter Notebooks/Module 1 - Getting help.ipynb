    "The pipeline refers to all of the steps needed to go from **raw, messy, original data** to data that is ready for any kind of analysis. In the real world, data is almost never ready to be analyzed without a great deal of work to prepare the data first.

    "The goal of this course is to make this huge part of the job easier, faster, less frustrating, and more enjoyable for you. The techniques we will discuss are not the only ways to accomplish a task, but they represent fast and straightforward ways to do the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How do we acquire data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * From external files with flat, tabular structure (Module 2)\n",
    "  * From JSONs, often from APIs (Modules 3 and 4)\n",
    "  * From web-scraping using `beautifulsoup` (Module 5)\n",
    "  * From remote access to an SQL database (Modules 6-7)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do we clean data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * With SQL queries (Modules 6-7)\n",
    "  * With `pandas` (Module 8)\n",
    "  * Including merging and reshaping dataframes (Module 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do we perform simple analyses to understand our data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * With summary and descriptive statistics tables (Module 10)\n",
    "  * With static visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (Module 11)\n",
    "  * With interactive vizualiations using `plotly` (Module 12)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, prior to launching into the data pipeline, we have to talk about the single most important skill for a data scientist: **how to get yourself unstuck**. That is, how to find the help you need to solve the inevitable problems, errors, and anomalies that will occur as you code. Remember, being a great data scientist does NOT mean doing everything perfectly. Great data scientists make mistakes just as often as anyone else. Whet sets them apart is their skill in using help resources to get to the **right answer, as quickly as possible**. In this notebook, we will discuss the various methods and resources at your disposal for finding help, and the *order* in which you should employ each resource. If you practice these skills for getting yourself unstuck, you won't have any trouble squashing all the bugs in your code:\n",

    "1.  Python documentation\n",
    "2.  Google\n",
    "3.  Stack Overflow\n",

I strongly suggest that you do **not** look to Google and Stack Overflow before trying to use the official Python built-in documentation. The documentation isn't as intuitive and easy to access as Google, but the answers that the official documentation will provide are guaranteed to be correct and specific to the functions you are trying to use, if you know what those functions are. In contrast, for all of the strengths of Google and Stack Overflow, there is a lot of information out there that isn't especially helpful and will slow you down a great deal."

    "Packages, modules, classes and functions in Python have built-in documentation that you can display directly in the console or in the output of a notebook. These built-in documentations are called **docstrings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"labwindow\"></a> Using a Console Window in JupyterLab\n",
    "The docstring should be the first place to look for help with specific, pre-built Python code. The problem is, calliing up a docstring is very annoying in a Jupyter notebook. Ideally, you should be working with two windows side by side: one for the notebook or script that contains your code, and one for calling docstrings and running commands to view saved objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest using JupyterLab (not just Jupyter), which is available from  Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/. Please take a moment to download and install Anaconda Navigator, launch JupyterLab, and open this notebook in JupyterLab (by clicking on the file folder icon in the upper left corner of the screen, navigating to this file, and clicking on it) if you haven't already done so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, click **File**, then **New**, then **Console**. This will open a console window, in which you type commands one at a time into the bar at the bottom of the window, pressing SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN to execute the command. Find the tab at the top of the screen for the console, and click and drag it to the side of the screen. The notebook and console windows should now be side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, click on the console window, then click on **Kernel** at the top of the screen, and **Change Kernel...**. That brings up a \"Select Kernel\" menu. In the drop-down menu, choose the name of this notebook. That loads all the packages and objects that have been stored in the notebook's memory in the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the console is very easy to use to call up docstrings or to run commands on the notebook's objects.\n",

    "* `help(function)` -- displays the docstring for the function in question.\n",

    "The next options involve becoming a **responsible, respectful** member of the worldwide community of Python users. Open-source platforms like Python and R depend on a community of volunteers who develop and maintain the tools that we use. All of these people are doing volunteer work for the common good, and that's a beautiful thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Python itself, Stack Overflow, Slack, the Freenode IRC, and mailing lists are online communities for Python users. But, like any online community, there's the potential for a toxic culture to destroy everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a toxic culture? How do you know one when you see one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxic cultures are more likely when\n",
    "\n",
    "* members are allowed to be anonymous (see [Lapidot-Lefler and Barak 2011](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/health-jones-lapidotlefler-2012.pdf))\n",
    "* and members up-vote and down-vote and comment on each other's contributions (see [Massanari 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444815608807)).\n",
    "\n",
    "A culture can be either actively or passively toxic. Actively toxic communities are easy to identify. They encourage and are characterized by overt sexism, racism, bigotry, and calls for violence or other aggression against individuals. Most of the toxicity you will encounter in online programming and data science communities is not actively, but passively toxic. Passive toxicity is characterized by **gate-keeping**: Subtle behaviors that discourage people with less experience, or with some social anxiety, from participating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack overflow, IRCs, and mailing lists are notorious for passive toxic behavior. Passive toxicity is a bigger problem for us than active toxicity because actively toxic behavior is usually explicitly banned by codes of conduct, and individuals are often unaware of when they are acting in a passively toxic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of passive toxic behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Condescending language**: often people who are trying to earnestly answer a question unthinkingly use language that makes someone feel dumb for asking the question. Avoid using words such as \"obviously\", \"clearly\", \"actually\", \"just\", \"that should be easy\", \"google it\", \"read the manual\" (or \"RTFM\"). Here's an [example](https://twitter.com/aprilwensel/status/974859164747931650).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shaming**: attacking someone for asking a question by implying that the solution is easy and that someone is an idiot for not knowing it. Some examples: \"Learn to debug your own code\" and \"If you don't get this, you have no business being a data scientist.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Downvotes without explanation**: this can be both confusing and very upsetting to anyone, especially to people with less experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Virtue signaling**: implying that people are superior/inferior because of the language, software, or methods they use. For example: \"Real programmers don't use for loops\", \"You still use SAS?\", and so many memes:\n",

For example, a comment that entirely ignores the content of the question but comments \"all questions must provide an example,\" or editing a user's post to remove where they wrote \"Hi everyone\" and \"thanks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overzealous curation**: Being very quick to tag a question as a \"duplicate\" without checking to see nuanced ways in which the question comes from a new situation.\n",
    "\n",

In addition, other potential new members observe these negative interactions involving other members, and choose to disengage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passive toxicity shrinks the community and makes it more homogeneous.** Across society, small, homogeneous communities are much more likely to exclude or discriminate against people based on sex, race, class, language} and other factors. And that leads to many ethical problems.\n",

A lot of the time, people answering questions on Stack Overflow can be, well ... huge assholes that cause [real suffering](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52). You might choose to avoid posting to Stack Overflow, so as not to support a website that has harbored abuse. That's completely fair. If you do post to Stack Overflow, you are likely to get some very useful responses if you follow some guidelines. There's [a strategy for getting good responses](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). You are more likely to get a good response if you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Stack Overflow and Google to see if the question has already been answered.** Commenters dislike if the same question is asked repeatedly. This [poor guy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885020/find-all-possible-combinations-of-letters-in-a-string-in-python) got roasted for posing a \"duplicate\" question. (An aside: *Why?* It's not like Stack Overflow is running out of space on their website.  There's an idea that Stack Overflow should be a central repository of knowledge. That means there should be one canonical answer to one question. But people often take this much too far. There are kinder ways to point to an existing answer.) So spend a significant amount of time digging through the internet. If there's something similar, but not quite what you need, you can say so in your post.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write a good title for your post.** A good title is specific about the problem, and also succinct:\n",
    "  * Bad: Problem with matplotlib (not specific)\n",
    "  * Also Bad: How do I place the labels of cars in a scatterplot of the weight and miles per gallon of cars onto the points in the scatterplot using matplotlob 3.3.1 on Python 3.7.4 on Mac OSX 10.14.5? (not succinct)\n",
    "  * Good: How to place labels on top of points in a matplotlib scatterplot?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start the post with a paragraph describing the problem in more detail.** Some good things to include in this paragraph:\n",
    "  * The context of the problem -- how did you come across the problem? Describe the overall goal, not the just the buggy step.\n",
    "  * What you've already tried to solve the problem, and what happened.\n",
    "  * What is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n",
    "  * You can write the version of Python you are using, the version of the modules, and the operating system on your computer, in case the problem turns out to be specific to one of those\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If possible, **include code that reproduces the problem.** The code SHOULD NOT simply be the code in your script that isn't working. It needs to be able to work on someone else's computer. That means the code should not depend on any specific data files, and should not contain file addresses that refer to a location on your computer. Only use modules that are easy to get. If the code needs to run on data, can you use something pre-loaded in Python that everyone can access? (There are example datasets included with `scikit-learn`, for example.) Make the code as short as possible, and use comments to help people understand the code more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be courteous and respectful. Respond to and thank everyone who comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post a follow-up once the problem is solved so that people who come across this page in the future with the same problem know the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask people to write code for you. It's better to request help with code your provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't claim you found a bug in Python or in a module. It's a bit rude to the people who programmed the code (who don't get paid).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't ask about homework problems. ([Here's an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23098699/calculate-the-mean-of-one-column-from-several-csv-files-in-r) of someone getting called out on this.)"

    "The Python user community is world-wide, and for the most part, very supportive. There are active internet relay chat (IRC) networks where you can post a question to members who are also logged in, to possibly get an answer right away. The most active Python IRC is the #python channel on Freenode: https://webchat.freenode.net. When I logged in while writing this notebook, there were 1,778 people logged on.\n",

    "Internet chatrooms can be rough places, but the #python channel claims to enforce this [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/). Getting started on Freenode can be tricky, but it's easier if you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://webchat.freenode.net/. Choose a nickname, and make it professional (you're a UVA student after all!) and unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Don't write anything under channel. Prove you are not a robot by selecting pictures of motorcycles or something. Then, once your humanity has been established, click \"Start\".\n",
    "\n",

    "/msg NickServ info\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important note**: DON'T use a password here that you use for important things like email, bank accounts, etc. We shouldn't have the same faith in the security of Freenode's servers as we can have in Google's. Also, this is the kind of platform that tends to attract hackers. And for people used to a graphical user interface, it might be easy to mistype in a way that accidentally displays your password in the chat. Use a unique, throwaway password!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To register this nickname, type\n",
    "```python\n",
    "/msg NickServ register <password> <email-address>\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `<password>` is a password you will use in the future, and `<email address>` is the email you want associated with this account.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Check your email for a confirmation code. Be patient, it can take up to 20 minutes for the email to go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Once you have the code, paste it and your nickname into this code, and submit it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "/msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER <nickname> <secret-code>\n",
    "```\n",
